Problem Statement:

There are n cities numbered from 1 to n.
You are given connections, where each connections[i] = [city1, city2, cost] represents the cost to connect 
city1 and city2 together.  (A connection is bidirectional: connecting city1 and city2 is the same as 
connecting city2 and city1.)

Return the minimum cost so that for every pair of cities, there exists a path of connections 
(possibly of length 1) that connects those two cities together.  The cost is the sum of the connection 
costs used. If the task is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:
    Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: 
    Choosing any 2 edges will connect all cities so we choose the minimum 2.

Example 2:
    Input: n = 4, connections = [[1,2,3],[3,4,4]]
    Output: -1
    Explanation: 
    There is no way to connect all cities even if all edges are used.

Solution: Kruskal's and Prim's Straightforward IMplementation. Implemented using Kruskal's here.

Time complexity: O(MlogM+M)
    Assuming N to be the total number of nodes (cities) and M to be the total number of edges 
    (connections). Sorting all the M connections will take O(MlogM). Performing union find each time will 
    take logN (Iterated logarithm). Hence for M edges, it's O(Mâ‹…logN) which is practically O(M) as the 
    value of iterated logarithm, logN never exceeds 5.

Space complexity: O(N), space required by parents and weights.
