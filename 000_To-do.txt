Puzzles
* 29x + 30y + 31z = 366 Solve it. This is a really good puzzle. 366 is the no of days in a leap year so no of months with 29 days is 1 (February) and no of months with 30 days is 4 and no of months with 31 days is 7. x=1, y=4, z=7.
* How many people must be there in a room to make the probability 100% that at-least two people in the room have same birthday? https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/birthday-paradox/
