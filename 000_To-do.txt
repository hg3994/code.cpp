==========
* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-palindrome-substring-set-1/
* LRU
* AVL Tree: Given a linked list make an AVL tree. I gave a solution in which I sort a linked list and then went to middle element make it as root and now I am left with right subtree and left subtree and same process is repeated recursively. He seamed pretty satisfied with the solution and then told me to write a code for the recursive part.

Theory
======
* Static Function
* Singleton Class: When it is used? Does it mean only one instance at a time or all in all one instance? Logic of constructor ?
* What are cin and cout in C++. They are objects of which class. Namespaces in C++.
* What happens when we press www.google.com
* Explain all the Protocols starting from ARP, RARP, BOOTP, DHCP.
* Does c++ contains automatic garbage collection?what is the use of free and del function in c++.
* kafka, factory pattern, synchronous & asnchronous
* Why is redis so fast?
* redis vs memcache: Caching: Why is it used? (Read more and write less kind of scenario)
* Load balancing
* Denormalization.
* Distributed state management
* Data Fragmentation
* Rate Limiting ALgorithm
* Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
* Login/Authentication in RoR?


Puzzles
=======
* 29x + 30y + 31z = 366 Solve it. This is a really good puzzle. 366 is the no of days in a leap year so no of months with 29 days is 1 (February) and no of months with 30 days is 4 and no of months with 31 days is 7. x=1, y=4, z=7.
* How many people must be there in a room to make the probability 100% that at-least two people in the room have same birthday? https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/birthday-paradox/

Things to do in the checklist
=============================
- Design Patterns
- C++ Essential Training


Behavioural
===========
- What are some positive things your teammates would say about you?
- What are some negative things your teammates would say about you?
- Why are you leaving this XYZ company?
- Why are you willing to join our company?


I can ask:
	- How is life at your company?
	-
